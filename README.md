# cluster-api

This repository is used to contain all the Python scripts that would be put in the cluster and have interaction with the UI backend.

After cloning the repository, the value of root_dir in main.py must be set manually to the top-level directory into which all calculations will run.  This directory must have rwx permissions for the owner.
